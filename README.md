# USBasp as DS18X20 temperature probe

USBasp (USB programmer for Atmel AVR controllers) consists of an Atmega88 or an Atmega8 uC. Since it can be reprogrammed and has a USB connector, it could be used as a simple communication device between computer and 1-wire temperature sensors.

Reprogramming could be done by another USBasp which are connected by supplied flat cable. On target device jumper JP2 must be short-circuited while being programmed.
